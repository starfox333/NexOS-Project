##Vehicle Body with advanced settings and lots of customisation!

#////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////#
# MAdvanced vehicle system for Godot 4+, created by Millu30
# This vehicle system was made with an intention to provide more advance features such as
# transmission, lights, tyre smoke, grip controll and more features while keeping it basic and
# easy to modify according to own needs/preferences, its more simply and easy to understand
# version of Vita Vehicles that utilize the VehicleBody3D and VehicleWheel3D Node.
# I tried to provide enough informations and explain what everything does for better understanding
#================================================================================================#
# Special thanks to OSH QRD for providing some tweaks to the car logic :)
#================================================================================================#
# Disclaimer! This might not be the most optimal way of solving some issues but it is enough
# to build around it. If there is anything that can be optimised or changed feel free
# to modify it as you like! :)

# Setting up keybinds and controlls for the cars is very simple, one can use a build in Input Map
# generator or simply add them manually, each car can have different Input Map Actions but overall
# script provides you the default actions for your all desires!
# Here is what default action keys should do what:
# Arrow Up or RT = Acceleration : Key Accelerate
# Arrow Down or LT = Brak / Reverse : Key Brake
# Arrow left or LStick to the left = Turn Left : Key Turn Left
# Arrow right or LStick to the right = Turn Right : Key Turn Right
# Q Or RB = Change Gear up : Key Shift Up
# A Or LB = Change Gear down : Key Shift Down
# Space or A = Handbrake : Key Handbrake
# F or Press LStick = Lights : Key Lights
# C or Y = Change camera : Key Camera
# R or Press RStick = Reset vehicle : Key Reset
# Z or X = Nitro : Key Nitro
#================================================================================================#
# Extra keys that are not available here, used to rotate camer
# This keys are addition and should not be modified in game if not necessary
# Numpad 4 = Rotate camera left
# Numpad 6 = Rotate camera right
# Numpad 8 = Tilt Camera Up
# Numpad 2 = Tilt Camera Down
# Tilting RStick on Joypad will rotate camera by default, numpad keys are alternative for keyboard
