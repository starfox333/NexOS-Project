class_name MVehicle_AI_NaviRegion # Class so it is easier to find in Add Child Node window :)

##AI Based on NavigationMesh3D and NavigationAgent3D, It has its own pathfinding which makes it
##viable to be used as a traffic or on race tracks

#////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////#
# This is where we set up our Vehicle AI based on NavigationRegion3D node, our vehicle should
# generate a path to the target and follow its generated points by default, note that this can be
# pottentially applied to PathFollow3D for constantly moving target but might require more micro
# management to prevent vehicle from taking the shortcuts or deadend routs.
# NOTE: This is sort of barebone AI and it does not have logic to reverse and avoid obstacles
# properly, however, it is planed to add contex steering to it so it will reverse and avoid
# obstacles in more efficient way, but it is still better than Follow AI since it does move
# on a defined are and will try to avoid walls and clifs if possible.
